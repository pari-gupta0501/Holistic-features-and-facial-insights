# 💇‍♀️ Facial Recognition & Hairstyle Recommendation System
---

A smart AI-based system that analyzes **facial features** using computer vision to provide **personalized hairstyle suggestions**. This project combines **facial recognition**, **holistic facial analysis**, and **recommendation logic** to help users find hairstyles best suited for their face shape and features.

---

## 📸 Features

- ✅ Face detection using OpenCV / Mediapipe
- ✅ Facial landmarks and geometry extraction
- ✅ Face shape classification (oval, square, round, heart, etc.)
- ✅ AI-driven hairstyle recommendations
- ✅ Holistic insights on jawline, forehead, and face symmetry
- ✅ (Optional) Web interface for uploading and viewing results

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Input**: User uploads an image or captures it via webcam.
2. **Face Detection**: The face is detected using Haar Cascades or Mediapipe.
3. **Landmark Extraction**: Key facial points (eyes, nose, chin, jaw) are detected.
4. **Feature Analysis**: Face shape and symmetry are analyzed.
5. **Recommendation Engine**: Based on facial geometry, ideal hairstyles are suggested.
